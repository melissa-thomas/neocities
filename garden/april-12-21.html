        <p>My friend Josh bought a house back in December that belonged to a couple of ambitious gardeners, and so he’s gifted me with a lot of bamboo and more containers that I could have ever hoped for, which means I don’t have to scour second-hand shops for them anymore, thank God.</p>
        <img class="post__img" src="../img/garden/4-21-peas.jpg">
        <p>Of course, I immediately rebuilt my pea-growing structure using the aforementioned bamboo. I also built another, smaller structure to grow sweet peas on.</p>
        <img class="post__img" src="../img/garden/4-21-greenhouse.jpg">
        <p>We had several warm days in a row this week, so I went ahead and planted out all my starts that were getting too big for their seedling containers—namely eggplants, two types of tomatoes, and four types of peppers. I hope I don’t regret it—I’ve definitely been lulled into false warm weather complacency before.</p>
        <img class="post__img" src="../img/garden/4-21-peppers.jpg">
        <p>I DIYed a bunch of garden markers by Gorilla glueing labels onto those little plastic 6-pack tops.</p>
        <img class="post__img" src="../img/garden/4-21-pansies.jpg">
        <p>I also got a palette of pansies in gorgeous colors from a local nursery that I’ve interplanted throughout the garden.</p>
        <img class="post__img" src="../img/garden/4-21-dogwood.jpg">
        <p>And finally, our Dogwood out front is blooming! The true sign of the times.</p>
        <img class="post__img" src="../img/garden/4-21-dunk.jpg">
        <p>That's all for now. If all goes according to plan, my next update will be very squash-centric. 🤞</p>
